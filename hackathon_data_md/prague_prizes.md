### About

LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables seamless communication between different blockchains. It allows developers to build omnichain applications (OApps) that can interact across multiple chains as if they were on a single chain.

Why build with LayerZero at a hackathon

‚Äî Reach More Users: Deploy your dApp once and interact with users and assets across all supported chains.
‚Äî Unify Liquidity: Avoid fragmented liquidity; build DEXes, lending platforms, etc., that leverage a shared cross-chain pool.
‚Äî Simplify Development: Build complex cross-chain logic using familiar tools (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.) and LayerZero's contract standards (OApp, OFT, ONFT). Get started quickly with the create-lz-oapp CLI.
‚Äî Enhance Security: Benefit from a configurable, decentralized security model using Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs).
‚Äî Improve User Experience: Abstract away cross-chain complexities, offering seamless interactions without users needing multiple wallets or bridging steps.
‚Äî Innovate: Explore novel use cases like cross-chain governance, gaming, data queries (lzRead), and complex multi-step workflows (Composability).

### Prizes

$2,500

ü•à

2nd place

$1,500

Develop a comprehensive solution using LayerZero Read (lzRead) to request, retrieve, and process external on-chain state from destination blockchains.

Your solution should use lzRead to perform cross-chain data queries and update state on the source or another destination chain based on the retrieved data.

Projects should focus on secure and efficient cross-chain data queries, using features like lzMap() and lzReduce() for off-chain computation.

### Qualification Requirements

1\. Utilization of LayerZero Read Features
Implement the lzRead protocol to perform cross-chain data retrieval from at least one supported destination blockchain. Use LayerZero's Blockchain Query Language (lzRead) to construct and execute data queries across multiple chains.
2\. Effectively request and retrieve on-chain state data from a destination blockchain using lzRead.
Process the retrieved data and update the state on the source blockchain or another destination chain based on the retrieved information.Demonstrate seamless synchronization and utilization of the updated state across the involved blockchains.
3\. Working Demonstration
Provide a working demo of your solution, showcasing the complete workflow from data retrieval using lzRead to state updates across chains. If the implementation is complex, ensure that all key functionalities are effectively demonstrated.

### About

Flow is a layer one blockchain with a powerful smart contract language (Cadence) and full EVM equivalence (any Solidity, smart contract, or protocol that works on Ethereum or an EVM L2 works on Flow). The network was designed from the ground up to enable consumer crypto applications that scale to mainstream audiences and seamlessly connect to digital ecosystems. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.

Flow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model and scalability without sharding, Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation.

### About

The \`\`Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) provides decentralized data feeds to the Flare network.
The Flare Data Connector (FDC) validates external data for Flare's EVM state (it's Web2Json attestation types can fetch arbitrary Web2 data). The Secure Random protocol generates a secure random number on-chain every 90 seconds.
The FAssets bridge XRP to Flare to use in smart contracts and build DeFi apps.

### About

vlayer aims to unlock web3's potential with robust data infrastructure. We simplify zero-knowledge proofs, making privacy and verification tools accessible to smart contract developers on EVM compatible chains. By integrating web2 data (web and email proofs) into web3 apps, we support a decentralized, secure, and efficient internet.
We are on a mission to connect the otherwise disconnected worlds of Web2 and Web3.
We are building a new category - verifiable data infrastructure. Our all-in-one infrastructure layer allows developers to extract, verify and integrate real-world data into Ethereum smart contracts, in the form of trustless claims. By integrating web2 data (web and email proofs) into web3 apps, we support a decentralized, secure, and efficient internet.
Our technology is powered by state-of-art Zero Knowledge Proofs and optimised to provide the best developer experience.
Key features:
\- Time travel: leverage history of on-chain data in your contracts
\- Teleport: compute cross-chain data from EVMs
\- Email Proofs: tap into trusted contents of emails
\- Web Proofs: bring private Web2 data on-chain
Benefits of building with vlayer:
\- You can use Solidity and existing tooling like Foundry
\- No needs to learn new DSLs or programming languages
\- Access the key data sources directly from your Solidity smart contract

### Prizes

### About

Beraborrow is the leading collateralised debt position (CDP) protocol on Berachain, unlocking instant liquidity through Nectar ($NECT), the first stablecoin powered by Proof of Liquidity. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, Beraborrow features modular, tokenized components that can be composed together to introduce powerful new features to the CDP design space.

### Prizes

üåäBest use of the LSP for stabilizing another protocol ‚∏∫ $2,500

Liquid Stability Pool offsets the debt of liquidations in our CDP module, we believe we can bring higher capital efficiency to the $NECT sitting there by having other protocols (Perpetuals, Lending‚Ä¶) making use of that available liquidity, with the condition that it ends up being profitable to LSP holders.
Develop a module that can plug into the \`LiquidStabilityPool::offset()\` function, ensuring that any other protocol can make use of its liquidity, without introducing any liquidity problem.

### Qualification Requirements

Qualification requirement:
\- Projects must have a description and a GitHub repository with a descriptive README.
\-\- How your module safely leverages LSP liquidity.
\-\- Why it's beneficial to both protocols and LSP depositors.
\- There has to be at least one practical example of a known protocol making a sound use of your developed module that plugs into the LSP.
\- Technically and economically sound.
\- Code must be open source and modular enough to plug into future protocols.
\- Berachain smart contract deployment.
Examples:
\- Lending liquidations (Aave, Dolomite)
\- Perpetuals liquidations (GMX, Hyperliquid‚Ä¶)

üìàBest tokenized strategy on CDP positions ‚∏∫ $2,500

Create a vault strategy on Beraborrow that automatically manages a CDP. Let users ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù‚Äîbut optimize for sustainability, yield, risk, and usability.
Our product, Managed Leveraged Vaults (MLV), keeps the position collateral ratio constant, while depositing the debt into our LSP, and rebalancing PoL rewards into principal.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Projects must have a description and a GitHub repository with a descriptive README.
\- As ERC4626 compliant as possible.
\- Technically and economically sound.
\- Deployed smart contracts over any Beraborrow collateral.
\- Deploy $NECT debt into multiple productive uses and not just LSP (It can complement but not anchor the strategy).
Examples:
\- Delta neutralising the collateral while earning PoL rewards above interest rates.
\- Debt yield optimization.

$1,500

ü•â

3rd place

$1,000

üóÇÔ∏è Design AI systems that are trustworthy, ethical, and sustainable by tackling data provenance, ethical sourcing, and fair attribution.
üóÇÔ∏è Leverage Filecoin‚Äôs decentralized storage and Data DAOs to ensure transparency, privacy, and equitable value distribution.
üóÇÔ∏è We're seeking modular, interoperable, and agentic solutions across data management, decentralized computation, and real-world applications.

### Qualification Requirements

1\. Projects must store data on Filecoin through on-chain storage deals, by using the hot storage layer - Akave or on-ramp storage providers such as Lighthouse Storage, or Storacha.
2\. Storing solely on IPFS does not qualify.
3\. Solutions can be deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) or on EVM-compatible Layer 2 networks that facilitate cross-chain storage to Filecoin.
4\. Additional credit will be given to projects that integrate with a data on-ramp contract to streamline storage onboarding to Filecoin from other EVM-compatible chains or building a data bridge from Akave to Filecoin where data flow works fully on-chain.
