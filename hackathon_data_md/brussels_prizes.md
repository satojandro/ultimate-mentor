### About

LayerZero is a smart contract protocol that enables applications to move data across blockchains, uniquely supporting censorship-resistant message delivery and permissionless development through immutable smart contracts.

### Prizes

üèÜBest Omnichain Implementation ‚∏∫ $20,000

Best Developer Feedback

$750

Deploy your dApp using LayerZero V2 and leverage our permissionless infrastructure, composable omnichain execution, and contract standards to win!

### Qualification Requirements

To qualify for the Best Omnichain Implementation track, participants must adhere to the following criteria:
1\. Interact with the LayerZero Endpoint contract using either the LayerZero Contracts Library or your own custom integration to send / receive a cross-chain message.
2\. Extend the Base Contract Logic: It's not sufficient to simply inherit the OApp / OFT / Endpoint interface contracts; the developer must also extend it. This means adding new functionalities, features, or optimizations that create new cross-chain use cases. The extension should demonstrate innovation and an advanced understanding of the LayerZero tech-stack.
3\. Working Demo: Hackathons have a tough time crunch, and we respect you all for learning to work with our tools so fast! Please focus on having the core contract working, and clean the rest up after.
4\. Feedback Form:When hacking, hard to use, buggy, or confusing documentation and tooling can ruin your experience! Please take the time to submit any feedback that you think might be useful for how we can improve your lives when building on LayerZero! The best feedback submission will win $750! Please submit using the form linked under "Resources".

### About

Uniswap needs no introduction and its upcoming version, Uniswap v4, reignites the protocol as a premier platform for developers. Uniswap v4 introduces Hooks, allowing developers to plug arbitrary solidity logic inside the swap lifecycle. Whether it‚Äôs pool creation, swaps, or liquidity modifications, developers can elect to execute solidity logic before and after an operation has happened.
Beyond hooks, v4 also introduces dynamic fees, flash accounting, ERC-6909 balances, and a singleton design ‚Äî all to enable gas-efficient complex operations.
From token-based fee discounts to MEV minimization, v4 provides an wide opportunity for researchers and developers ‚Äî regardless of skillset.
For ETHGlobal Brussels, the Uniswap Foundation will be giving out 20,000 USDC in prizes!

### About

Blockscout is a full-featured, open-source block explorer supporting chains throughout the ecosystem. Applications can use Blockscout in the same ways they use other explorers - to track transactions & addresses, verify and interact with smart contracts, and connect with APIs to enable application functionality. There are several APIs available including RPC endpoints (which can easily substituted for any Etherscan calls), ETH RPC endpoints and REST API endpoints.

### Prizes

üî≠Best use of Blockscout Block Explorer ‚∏∫ $20,000

Split with up to 95 teams (capped at $211 per team)

We need more üëÄ and üëÇ on Blockscout! To achieve this, we need apps to start using Blockscout's robust APIs and link to Blockscout when users are checking transactions, addresses and tokens. This is a great add-on bounty as Blockscout is compatible with many chains. Incorporate Blockscout into your hackathon project and qualify for a share of the pool prize!

### Qualification Requirements

We want to see how your project incorporates Blockscout. When applying for this bounty, please provide links/screenshots and clearly state how you used Blockscout with your project.
1\. Use Blockscout instead of Etherscan or another explorer in your app. Typically this means using the Blockscout APIs and linking to Blockscout for users interacting with your app (ie transaction links should go to Blockscout rather than another explorer). We have a REST API as well as RPC API endpoints available for use.
2\. Verify your smart contract(s) using Blockscout.
3\. Show Blockscout in your presentation. Show Blockscout in your presentation when checking transactions!
4\. Optional - prepare and submit your DApp to the DAppscout marketplace.

üèÜ Large Scale Compute ‚∏∫ $1,000

Starknet provides developers with really low fees. Another way to look at low fees is ‚Äúmore compute‚Äù. Create a Starknet-based protocol that uses significantly more gas than Ethereum applications to achieve something previously impossible on Ethereum.
There are two obvious ways to think about this problem:
1\. Now that fees are cheap, will protocol participants be willing to pay fractions of a cent more to do the ‚Äòhousekeeping‚Äô for a protocol:
1\. Rebalance other users‚Äô positions in your protocol
2\. Reduce back-running arbitrage by solving for it onchain
3\. Trigger abstract cron jobs with left over gas
2\. Some problems have high-complexity classes that may now be executable on the chain at a reasonable price.
1\. Some intractable problems have reasonable heuristic or stochastic solutions that may now be possible.
2\. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulation may be possible (randomness is available from the Pragma oracle)
3\. Problems in NP may be achievable for a small number of elements. For example:
1\. Closing back-running arbitrage may be quite expensive to compute, but it may still be worth doing a naive strategy on-chain up to a certain level of gas consumption.
2\. Traveling salesman for a tiny number of accounts may be possible.

### Qualification Requirements

1\. A working, on-chain, Starknet-based smart contract deployed on Sepolia that clearly uses an order of magnitude higher compute than current L1-based applications.
2\. The increased compute must differentiate the protocol or be the protocol's sole reason for existence.

### Prizes

üîóChain Signatures: Cross-Chain Without Bridges ‚∏∫ $5,000

Building a cross-chain product? Meet Chain Signatures: the latest programmable MPC technology which enables cross-chain protocols to support every chain (even non-smart contract chains), eliminate the risk of bridging, and unify user experience.
Demonstrate a creative use case of the Chain Signatures technology in which you use a NEAR account or smart contract to sign transactions on any given chain, whether it‚Äôs Ethereum or Bitcoin. Get creative and explore the beginnings of chain abstraction, where users can do everything from a single account and don‚Äôt have to think about which chain they are on!
Ideas
\+ DeFi on Bitcoin and other non-smart contract chains: Build DeFi applications for non-smart contract chains using NEAR smart contracts and Chain Signatures to control externally-owned accounts on chains like Bitcoin and BitTensor.
\+ Bridgeless Cross-Chain Swaps: Execute cross-chain swaps without bridges by atomically swapping the ownership of two accounts on different chains (e.g. $BTC on Bitcoin <> $USDC on Optimism).
\+ Multichain dApps: Utilize NEAR as the smart contract layer to interact with assets on Ethereum, Bitcoin and other chains, enabling multichain DEXs, lending protocols, DAO, staking platforms.
\+ dYdX-based products: Leverage Chain Signatures to manage dYdX positions and build products on top of the dYdX platform.
\+ Account Aggregation: Control multiple accounts or sign transactions on different chains using a single NEAR account.

### Qualification Requirements

Your deployment should be on the NEAR testnet.
You are free to incorporate any ECDSA-based blockchain(s) of your choice (Bitcoin, Cosmos chains, L1s/L2s EVM, etc.)
Your submission must NOT be a simple fork of an existing example/project with minimal changes.
Your submission should include a basic readme file explaining the scope of the project.
Your submission should demonstrate a creative chain signatures API use case.

### About

ApeCoin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token. It will serve as the native gas token for ApeChain. Web3 builders and creators including Yuga Labs, the company that founded Bored Ape Yacht Club, use ApeCoin to power their economies. ApeCoin adoption is driven largely by communities who are driving culture forward through NFTs, art, gaming, entertainment, community and events.
The ApeCoin community governs itself via the ApeCoin DAO, the decentralized governance framework that supports the Ecosystem Fund. The ApeCoinDAO serves to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.
ApeCoin serves several purposes including:
Transaction fees - transactions on ApeChain are natively paid in $APE
Governance - allows ApeCoin holders to participate in the ApeCoin DAO
Unification of Spend - shared and open currency across more NFT native communities
Access - exclusive games, merch, events, and services
Incentivization - tool for third-party developers to incorporate APE into their services, games, and other projects
Jenkins is Apechain's public alpha testnet. It mirrors the general vision of the Apechain network, which is an L3 on top of Arbitrum. Apecoin is the native gas token and devs can onboard onto it and use it like any other testnet like bridge to it, deploy smart contracts, connect it to your Metamask, etc.

### Prizes

### About

Zircuit is a fully EVM-compatible ZK rollup with parallelized circuits and AI-enabled security at the sequencer level. Built by a team of web3 security veterans and PhDs in computer science, algorithms, and cryptography, Zircuit is backed by Pantera Capital, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom.

### Prizes

üåüBest Project on Zircuit ‚∏∫ $2,500

The best projects that deploy on Zircuit will win this prize. The code should be well engineered, tested, and have a compelling use case. These gems are the projects that will inspire future hackathon projects because of their outstanding quality. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework + as long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified, the project is eligible.
A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it‚Äôs intended to address. It will showcase some innovation/creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem or introduce something with a lot of potential for future development. Either way, it has an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem.
Winning projects should have a user-centered design that makes it easy for their audience. This can be end users or developers. The best may also include clean and consistent visual designs.
Any interesting blockchain applications are welcome. Novel ideas are more impressive than clones of existing projects, though there are certainly times where clones include significant improvements. Any use case and features are welcome! Those that are very technical may impress the judges if done correctly but simpler ideas may be easier to do well.
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
\- A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:
1) a clear short one-sentence description of your submission.
2) a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how.
3) a short description of the team and their backgrounds.

üî•Best DeFi Project on Zircuit ‚∏∫ $1,875

Zicuit‚Äôs full EVM compatibility means that everything can scale, securely. Apply your hacking skills to generate the best APY or improve the user experience of DeFi for the masses on Zircuit. This prize will be split among the best DeFi protocols that deploy on Zircuit, with quality, security, and novelty being the deciding factors. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework and a project is eligible as long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified.
These DeFi protocols are the ones that will launch a new DeFi summer. Your project should be clearly identifiable as a DeFi protocol. Quality, completeness, and security are paramount. A protocol that lets you (or others!) steal from your users is not a winning submission. Use cases should be well thought out and documented. Through superior UI/UX or novel use cases for staking, your project should aim to give well established DeFi juggernauts cause for concern.
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, & creativity.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
\- A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:
1) a clear short one-sentence description of your submission.
2) a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how.
3) a short description of the team and their backgrounds.
4) clear instructions for testing the integration.
5) feedback describing your experience with building on Zircuit.
6)voptionally, a short video demo or slide deck.

### Prizes

üèÜBest Application for Cross-Border Payments ‚∏∫ $2,000

Build an application (either mobile or web app) that uses the blockchain for cost-effective international money transfers, saving costs while enhancing margins. Extra points for also incorporating AI into your solution.
Examples of applications include:
Examples:
\\* Payroll platforms - Streamline global salary disbursements with blockchain to reduce costs and ensure timely payments.
\\* International Remittances - Facilitate low-cost, secure, and near-instant international money transfers for individuals.
\\* Peer-to-Peer payments - Enable direct, cost-effective money transfers between users with a simple and intuitive interface.
\\* Marketplaces - Create an online marketplace with decentralized payments to minimize intermediary fees and enhance security.
Examples with AI:
\\* Using machine learning to take blacklisted/banned wallets that are currently known across different blockchains to build a predictive model to identify other wallets and transactions that could be of high risk.
\\* Using AI to show cost savings for sending funds in USDC vs. traditional payment rails.
\\* Use AI to optimize payments by identifying security issues with the smart contract by analyzing the code. AI may also be used to identify greater efficiency, and reduction of gas fees related to compute. In order to be USDC specific, the fine-tuning would be related to any smart contracts interacting with Circle smart contracts or known wallets.

### About

Galadriel is the first L1 blockchain purpose-built for AI.
\*\*
ETH brought devs smart contracts to build dApps. Similarly, Galadriel enables devs to build AI apps & agents like smart contracts ‚Äî in Solidity, decentralized, and on-chain.
\*\*
Galadriel is built on a parallel-execution EVM stack to bring state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models) on-chain in a low-cost, low-latency, and verifiable manner through Galadriel‚Äôs teeML. This makes it possible for devs to experiment & build highly capable AI agents on-chain.

### Prizes

Build and deploy on-chain AI agent(s) on Galadriel Devnet. To build AI agents on-chain, Galadriel makes it possible to call LLMs in Solidity smart contracts, however, an AI agent is more than just calling an LLM for a single response. All essential components of an AI agent are the following:
\\*\\*\\*
1\. LLM: the core engine of any language-based AI agent \[https://docs.galadriel.com/teeML-features\]
\_\_
2\. system prompt: the initial text input to LLM that describes how the agent will operate, could also include a persona description for the agent, try Googling ‚Äúagent system prompt‚Äù
\[https://docs.galadriel.com/tutorials/agents#before-agents-single-llm-call\]
\_\_
3\. memory: there are 2 types of memory - chat history & knowledge base (RAG) that give the LLM context on previous messages with the user and any domain-specific knowledge, that the base LLM has not been trained on
\[https://docs.galadriel.com/tutorials/rag\]
\_\_
4\. tools: enable the LLM agent to interact with external environments, e.g. web search, code execution environment, image generation
\[https://docs.galadriel.com/tutorials/agents#adding-a-tool-web-search\]
\_\_
5\. running in a loop: calling out the LLM concurrently inside a loop to feed in every previous output, enables it to reason about its actions or ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù to complete a user-given task
\[https://docs.galadriel.com/tutorials/agents#example-run-with-an-llm-loop\]
\\*\\*\\*
Galadriel makes these features available for devs to build AI agents on-chain.

### Qualification Requirements

1\. The project must be deployed on Galadriel Devnet.
2\. Must include clear instructions on how to use it.
3\. A short description is included that explains how Galadriel is used in the project.
4\. The project must involve on-chain AI features by Galadriel. The team will manually check for this. Also, deploying just regular EVM contracts without any AI use case will not count.
When picking the winner Galadriel team considers 1) usability, 2) uniqueness, and 3) technical execution.

üíéMulti Agent System Bounty ‚∏∫ $4,000

Build and deploy more than 3 on-chain AI agents, that are interconnected and can communicate with each other via a shared interface, on Galadriel Devnet.
\-\-\--------
Such systems are called multi agent systems, which could be implemented as Sims-like games where multiple AI agents roam in a shared environment, and interact as NPCs, or a multi agent system can be thought as a team of agents working together to solve a given task (think like a team in a company).
\-\-\--------
For this track, we'd expect most of the effort going into figuring out how the on-chain agents can be built to communicate with each other on-chain.
\-\-\--------
So the best is to start by 1st understanding how LLMs work on Galadriel, then go through a single on-chain Agent example (both available as tutorials in our docs), and after that think how to connect more than one agent for your specific use case.
\-\-\--------
Here's some extra materials about multi-agent examples from web2 world:
1\. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJwR5pv0\_gs
2\. https://github.com/py499372727/AgentSims
3\. https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent\_chat/


### Qualification Requirements

### About

Scroll is a zero-knowledge rollup built to scale Ethereum. We're committed to Ethereum's ethos, and like to call ourselves the community-first zkEVM. If you‚Äôre experienced in building on Ethereum, your code, dependencies, and tooling work with Scroll out of the box. This is possible because our network is compatible with EVM bytecode and designed to feel just like developing on Ethereum.

### Prizes

Fhenix is an L2 on ETH that uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to provide confidentiality. For our track, we are looking for developers who are interested in building full-stack applications in the Fhenix ecosystem that use encrypted computation. This can be anything from on-chain social media, dark pools, private lending, confidential voting, etc. We‚Äôre open to ideas and look forward to seeing what you and your team come up with!

### Qualification Requirements

We require a full stack application demonstration, live hosting is preferred but not mandatory. However, creating an application that others can play around with from their own machines would be beneficial for the team's prospects of being selected. A Github repository with a history of commits is also required. In addition to a corresponding readme that makes it easy for developers, judges and our team to understand the overarching architecture of the project submission. Finally teams must submit their official application before the deadline in order to qualify for prize considerations.

### About

A stateless layer2 of Ethereum, offering extreme scalability and privacy at the same time. Both data preservation and zkp computation happen on the client-side, then validators have to do almost nothing and have very low requirements. This unlimited number of parallelization, unstoppability, and privacy make this protocol unique.
