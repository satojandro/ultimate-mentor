$10,000

[ens.domains](https://ens.domains/) [ensdomains](https://twitter.com/ensdomains)

[Open page ‚Üí](https://ethglobal.com/events/taipei/prizes/ens)

### About

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralised naming protocol for the new internet.

ENS enables you to have a portable web3 username and profile. Use it to establish an online identity, simplify crypto payments for any blockchain, host decentralised websites, and more. ENS supports all DNS names (.com, .xyz, etc.) in addition to our native .eth TLD.

### Prizes

üß∞Best ENS Infrastructure ‚∏∫ $2,500

ENS is simple on the surface, but there are a number of backend infrastructure pieces that could make ENS even easier to use for developers! We'd love to see you get creative, but will get you started with two ideas:

‚Ä¢ A backend service that indexes ENS resolver smart contracts for events where people attach an IPFS hash to their name, and automatically pins those files. Build this as an easy-to-self-host Docker container so anybody can run their own instance!

‚Ä¢ An API that relays signatures to multiple L2 chains for setting reverse records. This feature is only on testnet right now, but building the API now could lead to it being a core piece of ENS infrastructure when it's launched on mainnet in the coming weeks!

### Qualification Requirements

Since this is an open-source infrastructure prize, your project should have clear instructions on how to self-host the service in the GitHub's readme file. A local demo is acceptable since it's intended to self-host, but a deployed version would be even better.

Using ENS on Sepolia or another Ethereum testnet is allowed.

Presenting on Sunday is required! We understand it's difficult, but we simply don't have time to review online submissions while also judging in person.

‚õìÔ∏è Best L2 Subname Experience with Durin ‚∏∫ $4,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $2,000

Every app needs identity, and Durin makes it easy to build that with ENS on L2s. We want to see the smoothest experience you can come up with for creating subnames in your app.

Think about a smart account that creates an ENS subnames (like basenames) at the time of deployment, or AI agents that each have a rich profile powered by ENS text records.

### Qualification Requirements

Your project must be functioning with live data on a public URL by the time of submission. You must have deployed a registrar smart contract to use with Durin (instructions in the docs below). Please come to our booth if you have any questions!

Any type of ENS integration is eligible for this prize. Get creative!

An example of a successful project may be a smart contract wallet that mints an ENS subname on L2 and sets its primary name upon deployment. If you're building an AI project, consider how ENS can be used to name autonomous agents. Come by our booth for help brainstorming ways to integrate ENS into your project!

### Qualification Requirements

Your project must be functioning with live data on a public URL by the time of submission. Using ENS on Sepolia or another Ethereum testnet is allowed, but hardcoded data does not count.

### About

Flow is a layer one blockchain with a powerful smart contract language (Cadence) and full EVM equivalence (any Solidity, smart contract, or protocol that works on Ethereum or an EVM L2 works on Flow). The network was designed from the ground up to enable consumer crypto applications that scale to mainstream audiences and seamlessly connect to digital ecosystems. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.
Flow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model. Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation. With over 45-million consumer accounts connected to experiences from the NBA, NFL, and Disney, the next killer app is being built on Flow.

### Prizes

üê±Best Project on Zircuit ‚∏∫ $2,500

The best project that deploys on Zircuit will win this prize. The code should be well engineered, tested, and have a compelling use case. These gems are the projects that will inspire future hackathon projects because of their outstanding quality. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework. As long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified, the project is eligible.
A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it‚Äôs intended to address. It will showcase some innovation/creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem or introduce something with a lot of potential for future development. Either way, it has an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem.
Winning projects should have a user-centered design that makes it easy for the target audience. This can be end users or developers integrating the project into their own codebase. The best may also include clean and consistent visual designs.
Any interesting blockchain applications are welcome. Novel ideas are more impressive than clones of existing projects, though there are certainly times where clones include significant improvements. Those that are very technical may impress the judges if done correctly but simpler ideas may be easier to do well. This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.

### Qualification Requirements

1) Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Mainnet or Garfield Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
2) A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:
\- a clear short one-sentence description of your submission.
\- a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how
\- short description of the team and their backgrounds.
\- clear instructions for testing the integration.
\- feedback describing your experience with building on Zircuit.
\- optionally, a short video demo or slide deck.
