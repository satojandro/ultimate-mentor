### About

Uniswap needs no introduction and its upcoming version, Uniswap v4, reignites the protocol as a premier platform for developers. Uniswap v4 introduces Hooks, allowing developers to plug arbitrary solidity logic inside the swap lifecycle. Whether it‚Äôs pool creation, swaps, or liquidity modifications, developers can elect to execute solidity logic before and after an operation has happened.
Beyond hooks, v4 also introduces dynamic fees, flash accounting, ERC-6909 balances, and a singleton design ‚Äî all to enable gas-efficient complex operations. As well, Position Manager in v4 was designed for complex operations and safe-staking.
From token-based fee discounts to MEV minimization, v4 provides an wide opportunity for researchers and developers ‚Äî regardless of skillset.

üèÜBuild MEV infrastructure product ‚∏∫ $2,500

Nethermind invites you to build MEV infrastructure to help align MEV in Starknet!MEV, or Maximal Extractable Value, is a concept in blockchain that refers to the maximum value that a miner, validator, or block producer can extract from manipulating the order, inclusion, or exclusion of transactions within a block. MEV is neutral, and when properly built and accounted for the positive forms of it support healthy markets and good pricing for retail users, which is critical for adoption. Some positive forms of this are solver infrastructure like Cowswap or UniswapX, or mempool infrastructure like flashbots.Due to Starknet‚Äôs current architecture MEV strategies that relies on gas manipulation or transaction ordering are less effective, but there are other ways to support healthy markets!As Starknet decentralizes, this will be more and more important to take into account for dAPPS.Your task is to find one of this ways and implement an application that leverage Starknet‚Äôs unique characteristics.This can include: Starknet MEV Mempool dAPP infrastructure that allows dAPPS to integrate MEV Similar to Privy as wallet infrastructure Intent Markets Support solvers providing best pricing for retail users New and novel ideas! This field is being heavily researched, and new ideas are welcome!

### Qualification Requirements

\- To be considered your project source code must be hosted on a code repository like Github.

### Prizes

üîóControl Accounts on Any EVM through NEAR ‚∏∫ $6,000

Up to 3 teams will receive $2,000

With the release of Chain Signatures, NEAR accounts can now easily control EVM accounts by simply making a contract call on NEAR. This enables to bring all NEAR benefits (low costs, fast finality, email login, built-in account abstraction) to any EVM, while also simplifying to build cross-chain products.
Use NEAR accounts to control EVM accounts, and help bring a better UX to any existing project, or solve a common problem for EVM users. Explore the simplest chain abstraction tool, and allow users to do everything from a single account so they don‚Äôt have to worry about which chain they are on!
Ideas:
\+ Cross-chain drops: build a dApp that allows users get assets on an EVM chain through NEAR linkdrops
\+ Multichain DAO: build an dApp that allows users to vote on NEAR, but executes the actions on one or multiple EVM
\+ dYdX-based products: Leverage Chain Signatures to manage dYdX positions and build products on top of the dYdX platform
Developer Tooling: Improve the developer experience by building or enhancing tooling around Chain Signatures (e.g. by adding more EVM RPC endpoints)

### Qualification Requirements

\+ You are free to incorporate any ECDSA-based blockchain(s) of your choice (Bitcoin, Cosmos chains, L1s/L2s EVM, etc.) but must include at least one network that settles on Ethereum (e.g. ETH, Optimism, Arbritrum).
\+ Your submission must NOT be a simple fork of an existing example/project with minimal changes.
\+ Your submission should include a basic readme file explaining the scope of the project.
Judging Criteria:
\+ Creativity and originality of the idea.
\+ Quality and completeness of the product.
\+ Code readability and documentation.
\+ BONUS: Feedback on the chain signatures technology and developer experience to help improve it

### About

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralised naming protocol for the new internet.

ENS enables you to have a portable web3 username and profile. Use it to establish an online identity, simplify crypto payments for any blockchain, host decentralised websites, and more. ENS supports all DNS names (.com, .xyz, etc.) in addition to our native .eth TLD.

### Prizes

üìùBest feedback on ENS documentation ‚∏∫ $1,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $500

We want our docs to be a one-stop-shop for learning everything you need to know to build on ENS. If you find a page that has confusing content, or feel that a particular topic isn't covered as much as it should be, let us know! Even better if you come to the booth to discuss a topic may have been confusing in the docs.

### Qualification Requirements

Open a GitHub issue with specific feedback, including a link to the relevant page(s) and what wasn't clear or what you wish was on that page instead.

Any type of ENS integration is eligible for this prize, from subname infrastructure to consumer social apps that use ENS for identity. Get creative!
An example of a successful project may be a smart contract wallet that mints an ENS subname upon deployment, or unique use cases for text records. If you're building an AI project, consider how ENS can be used to name autonomous agents. For L2 projects, we encourage you to explore the EVMGateway linked below. Come by our booth for help brainstorming ideas!

### Qualification Requirements

It should be abundantly clear how ENS improves your product and is not just implemented as an afterthought. The more ENS-centric it is, the better. Your demo should be functional and not just include hard-coded values. Upon submission, your project showcase must have a video recording or link to a live demo.

### Prizes

üèÜBest use of Chainlink CCIP ‚∏∫ $6,000

Up to 3 teams will receive $2,000

Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP! The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs, including token transfers and arbitrary messaging.
Possible use cases: Cross-chain DeFi app with liquidity across multiple chains Cross Chain DeFi yield aggregator Token bridge powered by CCIP Multihop CCIP Router. You want to send cross-chain message from blockchain A to blockchain B without worrying if the lane between them exists.
Use our CCIP Local Simulator to speed up your development on your local Hardhat, Foundry or Remix network, then use our Faucet to easily get testnet funds when you're ready for testnet. Links to both at the bottom in the 'Resources' Section!

### Qualification Requirements

\- Each project must use Chainlink CCIP in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible for the Chainlink core prizes. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink CCIP inside your smart contracts is required, though you are encouraged to utilize Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Data Streams, Chainlink VRF, and Chainlink Proof of Reserve as well.
\- While all project submissions are evaluated holistically, there will be bonus points given to projects that use multiple Chainlink services in a meaningful way.
\- Please let us know how you use Chainlink in the project description.
\- It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid.

### About

Hedera is an open-source, decentralized layer 1 network that operates on a proof-of-stake model, using the innovative hashgraph consensus algorithm. This algorithm is leaderless and provides strong security through asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT). The network is governed and operated by a diverse and decentralized council of top enterprises, universities, and web3 projects globally, ensuring responsible and transparent governance.Hedera's optimized EVM smart contracts enable developers to easily build applications using familiar EVM-based tools and infrastructure, and facilitate smooth deployment or migration across multiple chains. In addition, Hedera offers native services for tokenization and consensus. The Hedera Token Service (HTS) enables developers to create and manage native digital assets that interact with the EVM. These tools empower developers to build robust, real-time web3 applications and ecosystems, making the vision of a more connected and efficient internet a reachable goal.Hedera provides deterministic finality within 3 seconds, low fixed and predictable transaction fees, and fair transaction ordering with consensus timestamps. Its robust and scalable infrastructure makes it a reliable choice for developers.

### About

Flow is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain enabling the next generation of games, apps, and digital assets that power them. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.

Flow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer Web3 development and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains, ensuring scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model and scalability without sharding, Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation. With over 45-million consumer accounts connecting to experiences from the NBA, NFL, and Disney, the next killer app is being built on Flow.

### Prizes

Killer apps have the power to create and lead entire industries by addressing a pain point at the perfect moment. As an L1 blockchain designed for mass adoption and consumer-grade products, we believe the next breakthrough will emerge in the form of a Consumer App.Consumer Apps are consumer products that solve real-world problems by placing the end-user at the heart of the experience. Unlike traditional DeFi or ‚Äúx-to-earn‚Äù products that can feel distant to the average consumer, Flow seeks applications that are accessible, intuitive, and valuable to millions (or billions!). Think ChatGPT for artificial intelligence (AI), and how it made AI approachable and useful for hundreds of millions, enabling even non-experts to create custom AI tools.Possible use cases: Lossless lottery or fundraising where participants stake and a single participant gets the staking rewards. Regenerative finance or positive-sum DeFi. Games that guarantee fairness. Autonomous worlds and evolving games with playability and fun being more important than things like play to earn, button mashing or airdrop speculation. Impactful Real World Asset tokenization. Challenges with human or resource coordination. Inefficient marketplaces. A Telegram MiniApp

### Qualification Requirements

\- Your submission should be deployed on or connected to Flow
\- Your submission needs to be run on Flow
\- Your submission should be open source and free for others to check
\- Your submission must NOT be a simple fork of an existing project with minimal changes.

üè¶Best DeFi App on Flow ‚∏∫ $4,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $2,000

Flow supports EVM-equivalency. This means that all of Flow's protocol benefits, such as fast transactions, low costs, and mainstream scalability, are available natively, without any additional code changes to solidity contracts.

Flow bridges the gap between the wider Web3 ecosystem to achieve interoperability with Web3 and seamless integration with other EVM-compatible chains. Unlike Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, Flow offers a single, composable environment where dApps can interact without fragmentation. Adding bridges to the ecosystem will let assets move easily between Flow and other blockchains, expanding the functionality and reach of EVM apps. For example, a DeFi app on Ethereum integrating with Flow can benefit from lower transaction costs and higher scalability while maintaining connections with the Ethereum ecosystem. Or an NFT marketplace can easily interact with a DeFi protocol, enabling complex interactions like collateralizing NFTs for loans, all within a unified environment.

Building a DeFi App on Flow could potentially create amazing reactions with consumer apps, and there is an opportunity to create new concepts like ConsumerFi. We welcome all innovative products based on the DeFi track.

Possible use cases: PerpDEX, OptionsDEX, Lending Protocol, Crosschain/Cross VM Lending, Alternative asset lending, Yield Farming.

MACI is focused on building the most secure e-voting solution available. It enables on-chain voting processes with significantly reduced risk of cheating, like bribery or collusion, through the use of Ethereum smart contracts, encryption, and zero-knowledge proofs. Together these technologies provide a set of guarantees including censorship resistance, correct execution, privacy, and a receipt-free voting scheme, which ensures results are transparent but makes it impossible for outsiders to verify how any specific user voted. We believe MACI is most beneficial for governance and funding events, when the stakes are high and anti-collusion mechanisms are critical to help ensure fair and transparent outcomes.

### About

GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. A GaiaNet node consists of a high-performance and cross-platform application runtime, a finetuned LLM, a knowledge embedding model, a vector database, a prompt manager, an open API server, and a plugin system for calling external tools and functions using LLM outputs. It can be deployed by any knowledge worker as a digital twin and offered as a web API service. A new class of tradeable assets and a marketplace could be created from individualized knowledge bases and components. Similar GaiaNet nodes are organized into GaiaNet domains, which offer trusted and reliable AI agent services to the public. The GaiaNet node and domains are governed by the GaiaNet DAO. Through Purpose Bound Money smart contracts, the GaiaNet network is a decentralized marketplace for AI agent services.

### About

Gnosis is a collective of aligned projects revolutionizing payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all. The Gnosis ecosystem is underpinned by Gnosis Chain, a highly secure, resilient, and decentralized EVM Layer 1 network and also includes the venture-building arms, Gnosis Studio which includes Gnosis Pay, Circles, Hashi, Metri wallet and Gnosis AI Labs team. These projects are creating a radically inclusive infrastructure helping bridge the gap between blockchain technology and practical, everyday applications/use cases.
Gnosis Chain is operated by a diverse set of 200k validators around the world. It is one of the Ethereum‚Äôs first sidechains focused on resilience and credible neutrality as its core values. Gnosis Chain has fast transaction time of 5 seconds and low transaction fees. For instance, for 500 transactions $0.01 xDAI is required. The ecosystem support is ever growing, hence making it a perfect choice for developers to build dApps on-chain!

### Prizes

üåïBest Build with Circles on Gnosis Chain ‚∏∫ $2,000

Circles is a social money that allows people to collectively self-own their financial infrastructure, and build fair community currencies. Circles employs a unique token issuance mechanism where each user generates their own currency (CRC) at a steady rate of one token per hour, simulating a basic income system.
Deploy a dApp on Gnosis Chain or Chiado Chain which utilizes Circles (CRC) token and trust-relations infra.
Here are some ideas for you to hack on :
\- Using CRC as voting rights token
\- Using CRC tokens to form a closed group, use personal tokens as collateral and build out usecase for using groups
\- Using CRC token for events, use as a social platform to connect with people, trust who gets to be part of your network.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Contracts should be deployed on Gnosis Chain or Chiado Chain.
\- Have a working codebase with Circles SDK integrated and using either Human, Group or Organisation Avatar.
\- A readme.md file to support your usecase.

### About

Avail is a Web3 infrastructure layer designed to enable modular execution layers to scale and interoperate in a trust-minimized way. Avail is built to serve as the unification layer that coordinates interoperability and liquidity across the rollup-centric future.

### Prizes

üìùBuild with Avail  ‚∏∫ $1,000

Split with up to 1 teams (capped at $1,000 per team)

This pool prize is here for hackers to built something outside the scope of CDK/rollup infra. The goal here is to let your modularity creativeness run wild.
Build anything meaningful such as: -Using Risc0/SP1 to build custom application -specific rollup that uses AvailDA as the data availability layer. -Multichain/Appchain explorers
\\* As we head to a rollup-centric world, there‚Äôll be a need to explore the states of multiple rollups running on Avail DA. -Create an explorer that can fetch and view states of multiple rollups running on Avail. -P2P AddressBook: The Avail Light Client uses the Kademlia DHT for its P2P network to store addresses of peers in the network. The client uses a protocol called "Identify" to detect peer addresses (often referred to as multiaddress in libp2p).

### Qualification Requirements

Only Eligible projects will qualify for the prizes:
\- Projects integrating Avail for data availability or using the Avail network in a meaningful way (with utility) are eligible.
\- Projects using Avail's light client P2P network are also eligible.
\- Projects building upon or improving any of Avail's existing tools and technologies are eligible.
\- Projects that expand Avail's ecosystem are eligible.
\- Needs to be a new project. Any pre-existing project MUST mention what has been done beforehand and explicitly state what was accomplished during the hackathon.
