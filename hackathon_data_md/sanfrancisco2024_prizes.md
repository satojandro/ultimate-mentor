### About

Uniswap needs no introduction and its upcoming version, Uniswap v4, reignites the protocol as a premier platform for developers. Uniswap v4 introduces Hooks, allowing developers to plug arbitrary solidity logic inside the swap lifecycle. Whether it‚Äôs pool creation, swaps, or liquidity modifications, developers can elect to execute solidity logic before and after an operation has happened.
Beyond hooks, v4 also introduces dynamic fees, flash accounting, ERC-6909 balances, and a singleton design ‚Äî all to enable gas-efficient complex operations.
From token-based fee discounts to MEV minimization, v4 provides an wide opportunity for researchers and developers ‚Äî regardless of skillset.
With Unichain providing 250ms transaction times, expect to observe better transaction quality for Uniswap v4!

### About

Flow is a layer one blockchain with a powerful smart contract language (Cadence) and full EVM equivalence (any Solidity, smart contract, or protocol that works on Ethereum or an EVM L2 works on Flow). The network was designed from the ground up to enable consumer crypto applications that scale to mainstream audiences and seamlessly connect to digital ecosystems. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.

Flow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model and scalability without sharding, Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation. With over 45-million consumer accounts connected to experiences from the NBA, NFL, and Disney, the next killer app is being built on Flow.

Killer apps have the power to create and lead entire industries by addressing a pain point at the perfect moment. As an L1 blockchain designed for mass adoption and consumer-grade products, we believe the next breakthrough will emerge in the form of a Consumer App.
Consumer Apps are consumer products that solve real-world problems by placing the end-user at the heart of the experience. Unlike traditional DeFi or ‚Äúx-to-earn‚Äù products that can feel distant to the average consumer, Flow seeks applications that are accessible, intuitive, and valuable to millions (or billions!). Think ChatGPT for artificial intelligence (AI), and how it made AI approachable and useful for hundreds of millions, enabling even non-experts to create custom AI tools.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Your submission should be deployed on or connected to Flow
\- Your submission needs to run on Flow
\- Your submission should be open source and free for others to check
\- Your submission must NOT be a simple fork of an existing project with minimal changes
\- Your submission must have a descriptive README in the repository, including:
1\. A clear sort one-sentence description
2\. A short description of what you integrated Flow with and how
3\. A short description of the team and their social handles

### About

The Graph is a decentralized indexing and querying protocol for onchain data. It is the original decentralized data marketplace that introduced subgraphs, the most flexible way of indexing onchain data that builders can fully customize according to their needs. Subgraphs have become web3‚Äôs standard method of indexing and accessing onchain data.
Since its launch in 2018, thousands of builders have developed tens of thousands subgraphs across 70+ blockchains - including Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Celo, Fantom, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and more.

### Prizes

üèÜBest Project on Zircuit ‚∏∫ $2,500

The best project that deploys on Zircuit will win this prize. The code should be well engineered, tested, and have a compelling use case. These gems are the projects that will inspire future hackathon projects because of their outstanding quality. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework. As long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified, the project is eligible.
A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it‚Äôs intended to address. It will showcase some innovation/creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem or introduce something with a lot of potential for future development. Either way, it has an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem.
Winning projects should have a user-centered design that makes it easy for the target audience. This can be end users or developers integrating the project into their own codebase. The best may also include clean and consistent visual designs.
Any interesting blockchain applications are welcome. Novel ideas are more impressive than clones of existing projects, though there are certainly times where clones include significant improvements. Those that are very technical may impress the judges if done correctly but simpler ideas may be easier to do well.
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.

### Qualification Requirements

1) Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Mainnet or Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
2) A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:
\- a clear short one-sentence description of your submission.
\- a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how.
\- short description of the team and their backgrounds.
\- clear instructions for testing the integration.
\- feedback describing your experience with building on Zircuit.
\- optionally, a short video demo or slide deck.

üò∏Best DeFi Project on Zircuit ‚∏∫ $1,250

Zircuit‚Äôs EVM compatibility means that everything can scale, securely. Apply your hacking skills to generate the best APY or improve the user experience of DeFi for the masses on Zircuit. This prize will be split among the best DeFi protocols that deploy on Zircuit, with quality, security, and novelty being the deciding factors. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework and a project is eligible as long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified.
These DeFi protocols are the ones that will launch a new DeFi summer. Your project should be clearly identifiable as a DeFi protocol. Quality, completeness, and security are paramount. A protocol that lets you (or others!) steal from your users is not a winning submission. Use cases should be well thought out and documented. Through superior UI/UX or novel use cases for staking, your project should aim to give well established DeFi juggernauts cause for concern.
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.
