### About

LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables smart contracts to read from and write state to different blockchains. Developers can build omnichain applications (OApps) that can push/pull state, transfer value, and call smart contracts on other networks as if they were on a single blockchain.

### Prizes

üèÜ Best Omnichain Interaction ‚∏∫ $12,500

ü•á

1st place

$6,500

ü•à

2nd place

$4,500

ü•â

3rd place

$1,500

For the project that demonstrates the most powerful and creative use of omnichain contract interactions.
This prize specifically targets non-token transfer use cases that leverage LayerZero‚Äôs core messaging rails. We are looking for projects where contracts on different chains communicate and trigger complex actions with one another. Think beyond asset transfers and focus on building applications that synchronize state, share logic, or create a single, cohesive experience across multiple networks.
Ideal submissions will solve problems in areas like:
\- Omnichain Governance: Allowing a DAO on one chain to control contracts or treasuries on others.
\- Cross-Chain Account Abstraction: Creating a single "smart account" that can execute transactions on any connected chain.
\- Omnichain Identity & State: Managing a user's data or application state (e.g., game progress, user profiles) seamlessly across chains.
Omnichain Data Synchronicity: Ensuring data consistency, replicating critical states, or synchronizing off-chain data feeds across different blockchain environments.
To win, your project must showcase an advanced use of OApp (push-based messaging), lzRead (pull-based messaging), and/or Composer (subsequent messaging) to facilitate this interaction. Projects that creatively combine these messaging models will be viewed favorably.

### Qualification Requirements

How to Qualify
1\. Deploy a LayerZero V2 Contract: Your project's core logic must utilize a LayerZero V2 standard.
2\. Public GitHub Repository: Your source code must be publicly accessible.
3\. Show a Working Demo: Post a LayerZero Scan transaction hash showing your project in action.
4\. Complete Submission Form: All participants must complete the Feedback form linked below.

üèÜBest Omnichain DeFi Primitive ‚∏∫ $7,500

ü•á

1st place

$4,500

ü•à

2nd place

$3,000

For the most advanced and practical financial application built using LayerZero‚Äôs token standards.
This prize is for projects focused on the secure and efficient omnichain transfer of value. We are looking for builders who are creating novel DeFi primitives, extending the functionality of existing tokens (e.g., ERC20, ERC4626, ERC721), or building new types of omnichain infrastructure. Your goal is to demonstrate how LayerZero can eliminate liquidity fragmentation and create a more unified crypto ecosystem.
Ideal submissions will build novel solutions like:
\- Omnichain Yield-Bearing Tokens: Creating or extending an ERC4626 vault or similar yield-bearing token, allowing users to deposit on one chain and have their liquidity put to work on another.
\- Advanced Tokenization: Implementing a creative use of the OFT Standard to bring new utility to an existing token or using the ONFT standard to represent unique financial positions or assets.
\- Complex Value Transfer: Using Composer to build sophisticated, multi-step financial transactions. For example, a cross-chain swap that allows a user to send Token A on Chain X and seamlessly receive Token B on Chain Y.
\- Cross-Chain Lending & Collateral: Building a protocol where assets on one chain can be used as collateral for borrowing assets on a different chain.
To win, your project must be built upon the OFT or ONFT standards. Implementations that leverage Composer for subsequent value transfer operations will be highly regarded.

### Qualification Requirements

How to Qualify
1\. Deploy a LayerZero V2 Contract: Your project's core logic must utilize a LayerZero V2 standard.
2\. Public GitHub Repository: Your source code must be publicly accessible.
3\. Show a Working Demo: Post a LayerZero Scan transaction hash showing your project in action.
4\. Complete Submission Form: All participants must complete the Feedback form linked below.

### About

Oasis is a layer-one blockchain built to support confidential applications at scale. Oasis is home to Sapphire, the world's first confidential EVM network, Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL), a cross-chain privacy solution that can be used by any EVM dApp, and ROFL, a framework that adds support for offchain components to runtimes like Oasis Sapphire. With a unique layered architecture, Oasis presents the optimal building and execution environment for DeFi, AI, RWAs, Gaming, NFTs, DAO governance, and more.

Please note: The Oasis Foundation reserves the right to adjust the reward structure based on the quality and relevance of the submissions received.
What to build:
ROFL (Runtime Off-chain Logic) apps run inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). They rely on Sapphire for registration, billing, virtual machine management, and secure storage of secrets and configuration. Execution within ROFL takes place entirely off-chain, making it ideal for compute-intensive or always-on services such as secure decentralized oracles, bridges, AI agents, LLM chatbots, and more. Redundancy is possible with native support for replicas. Apps running in ROFL can also access its key management service, allowing Sapphire smart contracts to verify that a transaction was genuinely signed from within the TEE.

### Qualification Requirements

Qualification Requirements
\- Demo video up to three minutes long
\- A text description explaining the features and functionality of your project
\- An open-source Github repository with a complete README
\- A way to test the project, including a link to the app or testing instructions
\- Complete the submission form by the final deadline
\- Optional: Present your hack at the booth that you don‚Äôt get overlooked

Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework. As long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified, the project is eligible.
A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it‚Äôs intended to address. It will showcase some innovation/creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem or introduce something with a lot of potential for future development. Either way, it has an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem.
Winning projects should have a user-centered design that makes it easy for the target audience. This can be end users or developers integrating the project into their own codebase. The best may also include clean and consistent visual designs.
Any interesting blockchain applications are welcome. Novel ideas are more impressive than clones of existing projects, though there are certainly times where clones include significant improvements. Those that are very technical may impress the judges if done correctly but simpler ideas may be easier to do well. This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Mainnet or Garfield Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
\- A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:
1) a clear short one-sentence description of your submission
2) a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how
3) short description of the team and their backgrounds
4) clear instructions for testing the integration
5) feedback describing your experience with building on Zircuit
6) optionally, a short video demo or slide deck.

### About

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãChainlink is the industry-standard decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink has enabled over $19 trillion in transaction value by providing financial institutions, startups, and developers worldwide with access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across both private and public blockchains. Chainlink powers verifiable applications and highly reliable markets for banking, DeFi, global trade, gaming, and other major sectors.

### Prizes

üîóBest usage of Chainlink CCIP and/or CCT ‚∏∫ $6,000

Up to 3 teams will receive $2,000

Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP and/or CCT Standard! This track purely focuses on implementations that make sense in a multi-chain world and use CCIP and/or CCT standard to enable seamless interoperability.
\- The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs, including token transfers and arbitrary messaging.
\- The Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard offers a streamlined and decentralized approach to enabling token transfers across blockchains using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Traditionally, token developers had a friction-laden and manual process to enable their tokens for cross-chain operations.
Use our CCIP Local to speed up your development on your local Hardhat, Foundry or Remix network, then use our Faucet to easily get testnet funds when you're ready for testnet. Links to both at the bottom in the 'Resources' Section!

### Qualification Requirements

\- Each project must use Chainlink CCIP and/or CCT Standard in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible for the Chainlink core prizes. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink CCIP inside your smart contracts is required, though you are encouraged to utilize Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Data Streams, Chainlink VRF, and Chainlink Proof of Reserve as well.

### About

Flow is a layer one blockchain with a powerful smart contract language (Cadence) and full EVM equivalence (any Solidity, smart contract, or protocol that works on Ethereum or an EVM L2 works on Flow). The network was designed from the ground up to enable consumer crypto applications that scale to mainstream audiences and seamlessly connect to digital ecosystems. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.

Flow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model and scalability without sharding, Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation.

[ens.domains](https://ens.domains/) [ensdomains](https://twitter.com/ensdomains)

[Open page ‚Üí](https://ethglobal.com/events/cannes/prizes/ens)

### About

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralised naming protocol for the new internet.

ENS enables you to have a portable web3 username and profile. Use it to establish an online identity, simplify crypto payments for any blockchain, host decentralised websites, and more. ENS supports all DNS names (.com, .xyz, etc.) in addition to our native .eth TLD.

### Prizes

‚ú®Most Creative Use Case ‚∏∫ $2,000

Most people understand ENS' simple use cases (name ‚Üí address lookup, address ‚Üí name lookup, etc.), but few explore what else it can be used for. For inspiration, consider naming AI agents, storing interesting data in text records (like verifiable credentials or zk proofs), or auto-rotating addresses on each name resolution for privacy applications.

### Qualification Requirements

It should be obvious how ENS improves your product and is not just implemented as an afterthought. Your demo must be functional and not just include hard-coded values. Upon submission, your project showcase must have a video recording or link to a live demo (ideally both).

üë§ Best Use of L2 Primary Names ‚∏∫ $3,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $1,500

Primary Names are what make ENS names an identity ‚Äî¬†it's the way you can fetch a name for a given address. This is useful for displaying human-readable names in leaderboards, user profiles, or anywhere addresses are visible in your application.

Primary Names were initially only supported on L1 Ethereum, but as of recently are also supported on several L2 networks.

### Qualification Requirements

Your project must write transactions to the L2 Reverse Resolvers on the following testnets: Base, Arbitrum, OP Mainnet, Linea or Scroll.

Mopro provides:
üöÄ Easy-to-use CLI tools
üß± Ready-to-go templates
üìö Helpful documentation
No need to be a mobile expert‚Äîjust focus on your idea.
We initially support zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems including: Circom, Halo2 and Noir. Using UniFFI, you can also bring in any Rust crate and define the functions you want to run natively on mobile.
Tap into native mobile capabilities‚Äîsuch as biometrics ü´Ü, GPS üìç, NFC üí≥, camera üì∏, photo gallery üåÖ, Bluetooth üõú, push notifications üîî, and more‚Äîto expand what Web3 apps can do beyond the browser.
Let‚Äôs redefine what‚Äôs possible on mobile!

Build a mobile-native ZK app using Mopro. We‚Äôre looking for projects that showcase seamless, user-friendly experiences that bring ZK into everyday mobile use.
You‚Äôre free to choose any ZK circuit language‚ÄîCircom, Halo2, Noir, or others‚Äîand any ZK protocol, such as Semaphore, MACI, zkEmail, Self Protocol, zkTLS, etc.
Your app can be built in Swift, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter, or any other mobile framework. The only requirement is that the ZK proof must be generated client-side.
Surprise us with your creativity‚Äîand show how ZK can feel invisible yet powerful to users.

### Qualification Requirements

\- Generate mobile-native bindings (iOS/Android) using the Mopro SDK.
\- All ZK proofs must be generated directly on the client (mobile device). Relaying proofs from a backend/server is not eligible.
\- You may build on top of an existing mobile app (e.g., Self Protocol), but must contribute new code to the mobile-native layer (Swift, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter, etc.).
\- Apps that generate ZK proofs through embedded webviews or browser-based contexts are not eligible.
\- Your app should be run on an iOS or Android simulator or physical device

katana's edge
we designed katana for what actually matters to defi users and builders:
real yield
deep liquidity
productive capital
katana is built to make capital productive by aligning users, core apps, and protocol revenue
yield: from protocol-native revenue
liquidity: owned by the network
incentives: sustained, and flowing to active users via core apps and KAT holders via vote-escrow
no token printing, no mercenary capital, no fractured liquidity
just a system designed for the total value not to be locked, but productive: productive TVL

VibeJam ‚Äì Build Freely with the Katana Starter Kit
For flowstate coders, AI prompt wranglers, and vibesmiths who want to create without constraints. The VibeJam celebrates experimental, creative, and playful building using the Katana Starter Kit - a local, LLM-enabled developer kit that spins up a snapshot of the Katana chain for fast iteration and testing.
There‚Äôs no rigid spec and no requirement to use specific primitives. Just build something cool, composable, and fun.
Your project might be:
\- A new DeFi primitive with a unique mechanism
\- An AI-agent flow using Katana state
\- A meme-based yield game
\- A tool that helps other Katana hackers
\- A custom frontend for a Katana vault
The only requirements:
\- Use the Katana Starter Kit
\- Deploy something to Katana
Tips:
\- Join us for Forge on July 1st for demos, onboarding, and free Cursor licenses for qualifying hackers
\- Need inspiration? Explore the Katana Flywheel simulator (https://flywheel.bruno.id) or browse the starter kit repo for example contracts

### Qualification Requirements

Judging Criteria:
\- Technical Creativity
\- Reusability: Can others build on your hack? Did you build on others?
\- Vibe: Is it fun, useful, or meme-worthy?
\- Use of the Starter Kit: Bonus points for creative LLM flows or integrations with Katana primitives (extra points if you make a PR for the kit, or a constructive suggestion)
